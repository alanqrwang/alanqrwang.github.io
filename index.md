I am a PhD student at Cornell University where I am advised by Prof. [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/). Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, and computational imaging. More specifically, I am interested in designing data-driven models and algorithms that can improve image quality and decrease imaging acquisition times in biomedical modalities, including MRI and fluorescence microscopy. During my studies, I had the chance to work on anomaly detection at Google Cloud AI in 2021 and deep learning applications for wireless communications at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 2019.

In my free time, I enjoy playing music, running, and drinking tea.
