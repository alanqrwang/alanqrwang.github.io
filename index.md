I am a PhD student at Cornell University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I am advised by Professor [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/). Currently, I am based in New York City where I am affiliated with Cornell Tech and the Department of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medical School. Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, and computational imaging, especially applied to medical imaging. More specifically, I am interested in the interface between deep learning models and human experts, and how to bridge this gap in an algorithmic way. During my studies, I've also had the chance to intern at Google in 2021 and 2022, designing models for anomaly detection and ad prediction. In 2019, I interned at MIT Lincoln Laboratory designing deep learning models for wireless communications.
