I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University affiliated with Computer Science and Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, where I am advised by Professor [Ehsan Adeli](https://stanford.edu/~eadeli/). I am also a [Human-Centered AI (HAI) Fellow](https://hai.stanford.edu). Previously, I completed my PhD at Cornell University and Cornell Tech, where I was advised by [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/). Before that, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and medical imaging. In particular, I am interested in and have worked on developing deep learning algorithms for medical imaging and healthcare, with an emphasis on improving interpretability, robustness, and fairness of deep learning models in these contexts.
