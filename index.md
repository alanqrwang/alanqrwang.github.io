I am a PhD student at Cornell University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I am advised by Professor [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/). Currently, I am based in New York City where I am affiliated with Cornell Tech and the Department of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medical School. Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, and computational imaging. More specifically, I am interested in designing data-driven models and algorithms that can improve image quality and decrease imaging acquisition times in biomedical modalities, including MRI and fluorescence microscopy. During my studies, I had the chance to work on anomaly detection at Google Cloud AI in 2021 and deep learning applications for wireless communications at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 2019.
