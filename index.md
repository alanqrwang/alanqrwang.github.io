I am a PhD candidate at Cornell University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I am advised by Professor [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/). Currently, I am based in New York City where I am affiliated with Cornell Tech and the Department of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medical School. Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

My research interests include machine learning and computer vision, especially applied to medical imaging. Specifically, I am interested in bridging the gap between deep learning models and human experts like doctors and clinicians. This leads me to be interested in research in interpretability, explainability, interactivity, and robustness of deep learning models.

During my studies, I've also had the chance to design deep learning models as an intern at Google and MIT Lincoln Laboratory.
