I am a PhD candidate at Cornell University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I am advised by Professor [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/). Currently, I am based in New York City where I am affiliated with Cornell Tech and the Department of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medical School. Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and medical imaging. In particular, I am interested in and have worked on developing deep learning algorithms for medical imaging and healthcare, with an emphasis on improving interpretability, robustness, and fairness of deep learning models in these contexts.
During my studies, I've also had the chance to design deep learning models as a research intern at Google.
