I am a PhD student at Cornell University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I am advised by Professor [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/). Currently, I am based in New York City where I am affiliated with Cornell Tech and the Department of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medical School. Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, and computational imaging. More specifically, I am interested in designing data-driven models and algorithms that can improve image quality and decrease imaging acquisition times in biomedical modalities, including MRI and fluorescence microscopy. During my studies, I've also had the chance to intern at Google in 2021 working on anomaly detection, as well as at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 2019 working on deep learning applications in wireless communications.
